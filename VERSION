Versioning blog:

version 3.2 Dec 17	1) Segment qualification changed: EIAX = exonic/intronic/alternative/enigmatic, 5NC3 = 5'UTR/non-coding/coding/3'-UTR
			2) Added relational database (.rel file, see README)
			3) _all2all takes .cps as an input and creates a .rel file with all-to-all combinations of splice sites within each gene (a<b, a, b are sites)
			4) Added nematodes to _makespecies and to _makedownload
			5) _gtf2db need anohter variant, _gtf2db.1, one for nematodes where version number doesnt exist
			6) _gtf2db.1 deprecated; instead, an option is added to the _gtf2db
version 3.3 Jan 11	1) Fixed problem with Anopheles Gambie
			2) Upstream exon is removed from cps file
			3) Subseting is made clade-specific 
                        4) _select now takes -i -s -h in the command line; special is updated accordingly
 
			1) relation.h is renamed to subset.h
                	2) New relation.h is to load, keep, and manupilate with binary relations
                	3) added -b option to irbis to load relation
                	4) _gtf2db also creates .rel file which contains all pairwise combinations of d/a for a single gene
                	5) creation of .rel from _gtf2db is deprecated; instead, the _all2all utility creates .rel from cps
                	6) There is some issue with -b option; namely when -L constraint is introduced, the results for the same gene are not the same as without -b option
                	7) few changes to _makepdf: make sections sorted by left_id (one with the most right hits first); within each lists right_id grouped by gene id
                	8) added splicing schema

version 6.1	Jan 15	1) made by combining TOOLS and BISCORNS
			   scripts have been renamed as follows: 
				_finalize has become _tab2maf
				_makepdf has become _maf2pdf
				_transform has become _tab2readable
			   all species are in config.dat, ucsc.pm is depricated
			2) _out2bed got keys in command line; few bugs fixed which resulted in more segments and more predictions
			3) same strand control is coded in trim and _maf2pdf, removed from irbis
			4) finally! bad alignments are trimmed within align.pm module
			5) correlation utility got keys in command line, spearman correlation added
			6) _extract_relation utility takes the tab-delimited output from correlation and creates binary relation file (file is binary)
		Jan 24	1) _all2all now outputs a binary file
		        2) -bb -bt keys are providing input binary relationship for irbis (-bb for binary file, -bt for text file)
Version 6.2		Jan 29  1) Fixed bug with assigning too much space if the relation is given
			2) Still haven't addressed the issue with the intron file frozen by irbis; tmp solution -use check

Version 6.4		1) Configuration file is make for ALL subsets of db in the given specie
			2) command line to trim changed: -i species file, -r restriction file
			3) makefile changed: removed prefixes dm3/hg19/ce6 in the subset files
			3) finally implemented 5NC3 terms for upstream/downstream segments
			4) major restructuring in makefile: insect nematode and vertebrate removed; instead _makespecies creates 'database'
			5) irbis got two modes, one for joint intersection and another for separate
 
Version 6.5	Feb 23, 2012
			1) best_match.c was updated; -s flag added to report the scoring of particular splice site
			2) _intergenic_lncrna updated; Alessandra found that some of the lncRNAs inetrsect with antisense; 
	   		the precise criterion for selection of lncRNA is that (a) read line by line Thoma's file; (b) if location doesnt overlap with the antisense then report all sites from cps
Version 6.6	Mar 2, 2012
			3) orderedset changed; LOS1 and LOS2 are removed
			4) added the possibility for GT base pairs
			5) decided NOT to re-structure the dictionary package and focus more on fixing the pipeline
			6) changed the order of fields in tab-delimited output of irbis:
			   fields now are: species left_site right_site length start1 end1 start2 end2 score1 score2 seq1 seq2
			7) added indexing utility for sequence files (index.c)
			8) fixed incorrect placement of new indexing for the product array
			9) added sorting and check procedure for product hash table; names of the procedure changed in orderset.h
			10) re-wrote _tab2maf and _tab2pdf; now using hashes of arrays and pointers
Version 6.7
			1) perl modules are: utils.pm (creating makefiles) data.pm (reading all sorts of files) align.pm (mainly latex alignments) annot.pm (annotation in R and latex)
			2) correlation.c re-written; now can report the values aling with correlations (-t key)

Version 6.8
			1) Finally, the extention subroutine has been re-written
			2) _intergenic_lncrnas script got commandline options and also the overlapcan be stored in a separate file
			3) _tab2pdf & align.pm got subroutines for drawing boxes around exons in alignments
			4) few bug fixes dont remember which
			5) data.pm merged with utils.pm
			6) comments added, makefile changed
			7) now can read tilda in path names in trim.c
			8) Now segment margins are not converted to lowercase
			9) Segmentation fault in foldall was due to k<0 in progressbar, fixed

Version 6.9 Apr 25 2012
			1) added: automatics detection of TermKey Perl module and pgfplots in LATEX => now with a separate script _setup which creates setup.pm
			2) plots.cfg moved to plots.dat
			3) Bug with chicken genome fixed (chrom-sub=>chrom)]
			4) _onegene utility prints conservation pattern of genes' segments. Needs indexing files for that
			5) zumzum.mk completes pipeline for DIR, LEFT, RIGHT, OUT and PARAMS; metafiles needed
			6) gotye.mk  completes pipleine for DIR, META, and PARAMS; metafiles not needed
			7) bug with u=1 in irbis fixed inshallah	
			8) extend_bp replaced by extend utilmately; extend_bp removed


Version 7.1 May 11 2012
			1) Better, newer gtf2db; -test, -level and -only options added.
			2) Only segments, no windows (hopefully)
			3) two different hash arrays for transcript_type and gene_type
			4) sequence length limit is used by trim to avoid memory problems
			5) makefiles are redone so that now each makefile (database, metacalc) is separate, no includes, no problem with make clean
			6) _gtf2db now outputs segmentation, intron and exon relation tables
			7) got a progessbar when reading a long gtf

Version 7.2 June 8, 2012
			1) Structural re-organization: configuration files separate for results
			2) _makespecies -> _makedatabase
			3) name changed .index -> .ind; indexing script changed; ind files are included in metacalc
			4) in trim and irbis: threshold is now measured in percent from total weight
			5) _tree script is added to generate weighted sequences based on the tree (./_tree *.nwc *.cfg)
			6) There was a bug with non-unique ss ids in lncrna.cps; fixed

Version 7.3 July 4, 2012
			1) added: subsetting on cps at the stage of irbis
			2) gnu licence added to all scripts
			3) _gnuhead not necessary
			4) _sample and _xxx are under development
Version 7.4 July 10, 2012
			1) _gene_loci and binrel.pm added
